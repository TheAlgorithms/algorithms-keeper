    - ``delete_data``: list of the data input for each delete

    - ``delete_data`` attribute will only be populated with the data if there is any.
      Delete request do not send any data most of the times, so by appending the data
      all the time, the list will be filled with ``None`` objects.
    - Currently, there are only three requests whose response data is required by
      the caller, which are the three ``__init__`` parameters. In the future,
      others will have to be added if there is a need.
